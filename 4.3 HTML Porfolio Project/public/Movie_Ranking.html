<h3>Forest Gump</h3>
<p>This is my top movie, it's a great story and has some laughs. I cry everytime I watch it.</p>
<h3>Monsters Inc</h3>
<p>This is one of my childhood favorites, and will also be a classic in my eyes.</p>
<h3>Scarface</h3>
<p>It is Scarface, what an amazing film, truly cannot go wrong. It's a suspenseful, interesting Tarantino film.</p>
